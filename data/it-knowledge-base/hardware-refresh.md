# Requesting a Hardware Refresh

## Purpose

This article explains the process for requesting a hardware refresh (e.g., replacement laptop, desktop, or peripheral) when your assigned equipment is due for renewal or no longer meets performance requirements.

## Eligibility

Employees may be eligible for a hardware refresh under the following conditions:

- Device is older than 3 years (based on IT asset lifecycle).
- Device performance no longer meets job requirements.
- Hardware has sustained damage or is no longer supported by the manufacturer.
- IT has identified the device for mandatory replacement.

## Procedure

### 1. Review Hardware Refresh Policy

- Confirm that you meet one of the eligibility conditions listed above.
- Ensure you have backed up important files (e.g., to OneDrive, SharePoint, or another approved storage solution).

### 2. Submit a Request

- Go to the IT Service Portal.
- Navigate to **Service Requests → Hardware → Request Hardware Refresh**.
- Complete the request form with the following details:
  - Current asset tag number (located on the device).
  - Justification for replacement (e.g., age, performance, damage).
  - Preferred device type (laptop, desktop, etc.), if applicable.

### 3. IT Review

- The IT team will review your request within 3–5 business days.
- If approved, IT will notify you of the available replacement options.

### 4. Hardware Deployment

- Schedule a time with IT for pickup or delivery of the new hardware.
- Return your existing device at the time of deployment (see Return Policy below).

## Return Policy

- All replaced hardware must be returned to IT within **10 business days**.
- Failure to return equipment may result in charges to the employee's department.
- IT will securely wipe all returned devices in accordance with company policy.

## Troubleshooting

- If you are unsure whether your device qualifies, contact the IT Help Desk.
- For urgent replacements due to hardware failure, submit a **Hardware Incident** instead of a refresh request.

## Additional Information

- Standard refresh cycles occur every **3 years** for laptops and every **4 years** for desktops.
- Peripheral refreshes (monitors, docking stations, keyboards, mice) are considered on a case-by-case basis.
